	 e.g init process.
2. How to create a chain of processes?

3. In message queues how a reading process can know if the queue is empty ?
Can we build a communication between two unrelated processes?

	 Is it OKAY?

6. Difference between char const *a and const char *a? Explain with an example ?

	How the stack works in case of recursion?

8. what are variable number of arguments ?

9. Storage classes --list out scope and life of all.

10. extern and static . For instance in a file "a.c" int i as global, and

11. Linked lists..
		
		Given a pointer pointing to the last element of the list. How to find the head of the list without using temparory pointer variable? And the list is purely single linked lists?
		
		Given a doubly linked list? asked to write a program to find and remove
		the duplicates ?

12. static funtions : In "a.c" static sum() is defined and in "b.c" again static sum() is defined. Can we do so ? if so, why?
