		}xyz
		(*xyz)->i = 10
		printf(i) output of the code ?

*** part A Objective type questions 25

** which storage class is default in c program?
	a register
	b auto
	c static
	d int
	
** which key word is used for share the variables in multiple files
	a static
	b extern

** line1: char a[20];
	line2: a = "name";

	a valid
	b invalid
	give the explanation

** which one is incorrect
i   struct st
	{
	int a;
	char b;
	};

ii   struct st
	{
		int a;
		struct st b;
	};

iii	struct st
	{
		int a;
		struct st *b;
	};

 	

******* part b subjective type means we have to explain in detail

** what are the datatypes in c explain in detail?

** what is task and interrupt?

** what is scheduling explain?

** fn = f(n-1)+f(n-2) generates the fibanacci series f(1) = 1 and f(2) = 2
	a what are the software requrirements for this
	b write flow chart for this 
	
** what are the microcontroller peripherals give example and describe them?
