what are different storage sections (or) storage segments ?

 storage sections : IPL,STACX,HEAP,BSS,DATA,TEXT
 storage segments : auto register,static,extern

write a program for deletion of a node from double linkedlist ,base address of the node
given, header is availble globally ?

what is the output of the following program ?

int *foo()
{
int a = 10;
return &a;
}
main()
{
int *ptr;
ptr = foo();
printf("*ptr=%d\r\n",*ptr);
}

Explain about memory management module ?

Tell me how many types of sorting algorithms are availble ?, and which one is
the best ?

what are different types of storage classes are available explain each one ?

what is the sizeof structure and union ?
structure members are given like this
struct node
{
int a;
char a;
int a;
};
members are same for union also..........

What is structure holes padding ?

How the linked lists stored in memory whether contigeously or not ?

what is the difference between array and linkedlist ?

Which sorting algorithm is best for sorting ?

Do you know about any searching algorithms ?

  Cross questions on ovdc
           1)what is jiffes ?
	   2)which ipc is used for sending pid,jiffes ?
	   3)How will u calculate the cpu occupancy ?
	   4)Where this module is used ?
What is the output of the following program
int *ptr;
ptr = malloc(10);
you will get some address like 2004
if you increase ptr++;
How many bytes it will increase ?

How many types of the IPC mechanisms are available explain each one detailly ?

What is the output of the following program?

#define MUL(x*y) x*y
int main()
{
int a=5;
int b=6;

MUL(a+2, b+5);

}

where locally static intialised and uninitilised variables are stored ?

what is socket ?

what is the purpose of accept systemcall in socket programming ?
