RPC over XMPP (Jabber) Protocol
--------------------------------------
The Jabber or XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open
standard for real-time communication which powers a wide range of applications
including instant messaging.  XMPP communicates over XML format is a good reason
to extend this protocol for different applications.

- Implimentations Details
Basic XMPPC - Establishing Connection with XMPP (Jabber) Server 
Authentication - Athentication with Jabber server over MD5 digest mechanism

Jabber RPC extenson 
- The <iq/> stanza is used to transport XML-RPC payloads (commands) with set.
  Responses are built over 'result'
- Each stanza contains only one command at a time.
- Application-level errors will be indicated within the XML-RPC payload 
- Through this extension user can execute any command in rempote PC/Device.
  This application is also used to discover or start services in remotely.
- Built an infrastructure to add new commands dynamically

Building Remote Screen (Debugging Agent) over XMPP (Jabber) Protocol

Customized File Transfer over XMPP (Jabber) Protocol

- Implimentations Details
Basic XMPPC - Establishing Connection with XMPP (Jabber) Server 
Authentication - Athentication with Jabber server over MD5 digest mechanism
Jabber RDA (Remote Debugging Agent) extenson 
- This module is resposible to collect debugging related information from remote
  device.
- Client issues commands over XMPP '<iq/>' stanza, remote agent sitting on the
  devices polls for commands and responsds with relavent data.
- Each stanza contains only one command at a time.
- Through this extension user can execute any command in rempote PC/Device.
  Like collecting device configuration, Current status of any device, DB
  implement over linked list.
- Built an infrastructure to add new commands dynamically

Ping Over XMPP (Jabber extenson)
- XMPP Protocol Instant messaging works over TCP Port number 5222. 
- Incase of no messages are exchanged between two clients for a long time,
  Transport Layer (TCP) automatically closes connection after configured
  threshold value.  This breaks the communication between clients.  
- This problem is resolved by exchanging "white space pings" messages
  periodically between clients
- The pinging entity sends an IQ-get containing a <ping/> element 
- The pinged entity returns with an IQ-result

File Transfer Over XMPP (Jabber extenson)
- This exension enables users to transfer files between them while doing instant
  messaging.  
- This also enable seamless file transfer, including fall-back mechanisms as appropriate.
- Ensure that the profile will work even when one or both parties are behind a firewall.
