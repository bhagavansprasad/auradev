CAN Simulator/Utilities over SocketCAN 

SocketCAN is a set of open source CAN drivers over BSD sockets stack in Linux
kernel. Using socketCAN interface built multiple utilities which genarates
different CAN frames.

- SocketCAN utilities are built over RAW sockets where CAN frames are written
  RAW data format
- SocketCAN allows to simulate CAN bus over the TCP/IP Network stack using RAW
  sockets
- It allows different CAN Nodes to communicate over CAN Dev (Network).  Any data
  wrtten on CANDev is received by all CAN nodes who is listening on CANDev.
- CAN Nodes can "apply acceptency filter" by requesting Kernel with different
  CANIDs
- Kernel matches every CANID of every frame, if a match is seen between the
  filter and CAN ID the CAN frame is then accepted by the CAN engine and
  transfered into a CAN Rx buffer.  If match doesn't occurs, frame is dropped.
 
cangen -Is a utility which genarares CAN "standard and extended" frames.  Each frame
		  can be genarated with same or different CANID with different time
		  intervals 
		Based on requirements configurable data can be sent over CAN frames

candump - Is a utility is actually used for debugging purpose.  This listens
		over CANDev and read every CAN frame going over the bus reads dumps it
		in readable format

bcmserver - 
cangw - 
canlogserver - 
isotpserver - 
canfdtest - 

Advantages: Ease of development, Testing, debugging and fixing issues

Tools Used 
Wireshark : is wellknow network traffic analyzer, with which CANFrames can
			be analyzed better
GDB : GNU based source level debugger
gprof Profiler : GNU based profiler where code coverage can be messured.
