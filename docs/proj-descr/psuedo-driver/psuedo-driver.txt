Psuedo Driver (Charector Driver)
--------------------------------
This module facilitates to applications to maintain data in the Kernel (R/W)

Description
-----------
* Primary responsibility of this module is to maintain Application's (User mode)
  data in the Kernel (Kernel mode).  Applications can R/W data from User mode to
  Kernel mode and vice versa.

* Psuedo Driver is basically a 'Char Driver'.  Different application programs
  can store the ir data into Kernel module by sending specific 'Commands'
  through ioctl's

* Since every application has different data (Data Structure) to store, Psuedo
  Driver facilitates to define their own set of unique commands.

* Psuedo driver facilitates application programmers to add function in Kernel
  module (Charactor driver).

* Upon receiving ioctl command it copies data from user buffers to Kernel
  buffers and calls appropriate Kernel module function based on the command
  passed by the application

Examples
* Firewall configuration is done through application program (HTTP) and actual
  data has to be maintained in the Kernel as because all data packet processing
  happens in Kernel Mode

* DNS Client request is raised by applications (HTTP or FTP) but data is
  maintained in Kenel mode
