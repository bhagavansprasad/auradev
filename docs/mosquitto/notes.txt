As another example, for a topic of "a/b/c/d", the following 
example subscriptions will match:
	a/b/c/d, +/b/c/d, a/+/c/d, a/+/+/d, +/+/+/+

The following subscriptions will not match:
a/b/c, b/+/c/d, +/+/+

# can be used as a wildcard for all remaining levels of hierarchy. This means
# that it must be the final character in a subscription. With a topic of
# "a/b/c/d", the following example subscriptions will match:

a/b/c/d
#, a/#, a/b/#, a/b/c/#, +/b/c/#
