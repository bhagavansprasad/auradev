Hacking ELF
===========
This is a new debugging technique which used to hack/instrument the ELF file in
order to get the output with more debug messages.  This method is very useful
when the final image is linked with third party libraries. These libraries can't
debug as because source code is not available.  Features of this tool is

Hacking Global data - Find the address of a global variable in elf file
(a.out).  Replace the initial value with different value

Hacking functions - This allows to replace a function with a new 'remap'
function.  i.e. after hacking, remap_malloc() gets called in place of malloc().
The new function remap_malloc() is a function implimented by us with
instrumented code with debugs

This is tested on MIPS and x86 architectures in both protected and non-protected
modes
