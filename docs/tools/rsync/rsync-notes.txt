Links to configure rsync server

1. Edit the file /etc/default/rsync to start rsync as daemon using xinetd. The
   entry listed below, should be changed from false to inetd.

	RSYNC_ENABLE=inetd

2. Install xinetd because it's not installed by default.
	$ sudo apt-get -y install xinetd

3. Create the file /etc/xinetd.d/rsync to launch rsync via xinetd. It should
   contain the following lines of text.

	service rsync
	{
	    disable = no
	    socket_type = stream
	    wait = no
	    user = root
	    server = /usr/bin/rsync
	    server_args = --daemon
	    log_on_failure += USERID
	    flags = IPv6
	}

4. Create the file /etc/rsyncd.conf configuration for rsync in daemon mode. The
   file should contain the following. In the file, user should be replaced with the
   name of user on the remote machine being logged into.
	max connections = 2
	log file = /var/log/rsync.log
	motd file = /etc/rsyncd.motd
	log file = /var/log/rsyncd.log
	pid file = /var/run/rsyncd.pid
	lock file = /var/run/rsync.lock

	timeout = 300

        path = /home
        read only = no
        list = yes
        uid = nobody
        gid = nogroup
        auth users = cvs bhagavan root
        secrets file = /etc/rsyncd.secrets

5. Create /etc/rsyncd.secrets for user's password. User should be the same as
   above, with password the one used to log into the remote machine as the
   indicated user.
	$ sudo vim /etc/rsyncd.secrets 

	bhagavan:jnjnuh
	root:jnjnuh
	cvs:jnjnuh

6. This step sets the file permissions for rsyncd.secrets.
	$ sudo chmod 600 /etc/rsyncd.secrets

7. Start/Restart xinetd
	$ sudo /etc/init.d/xinetd restart
