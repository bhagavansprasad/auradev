32. CAN vs LIN?
33. CAN vs KWP vs UDS?
34. Why 7F has considered for €“ve response why not other than 7F?
35. What is tester present? Why do we need it?
36. What is security Access? Why do we need it?
37. What is CANCaseXL (if you have used it)? Explain with types?
38. If there are only two nodes on the bus, and both are transmitting same identifier
   (exactly the same identifier),who will win the arbitration or what happens?
39. If there is only one node on the bus and it is transmitting messages on the 
    bus continuously, what will happen? Is node will go into the bus-off state or what happens?
41. Is CAN full duplex? what is the significance of Extended frames other than that it can be used for generating more identifiers?
42. What is the major difference between CAN 2.0B and previous version?

What is RTR bit,what is dataframe ,what really happens ?
In remote frame request blocks until unless reply?
Where the data length is specified in extended?
Why SOF and EOF is required?
For acknowledgemnt frame DLC will be zero(yes/no)?
